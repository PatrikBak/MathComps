Classify a math problem using only tags from the JSON below ("CANDIDATE TAGS").
Both the tags and the problem are in Slovak. The format of
the JSON is as follows:

{[tag]: {"description": string}}

where the description is optional (it can be an empty string).

CANDIDATE TAGS:
{candidate_tags}

PROBLEM: {problem_statement}
SOLUTION: {problem_solution}

{already_assigned_tags_text}

Rules:
- Use ONLY candidate tags (exact spelling, case-insensitive match). Do not create new tags
- Any number of tags may be approved, but they must be relevant. Each tag must be somehow related to the solution.

You must output a JSON (and only this JSON) with the following format:
{[tag]: {"GoodnessOfFit": float, "Justification": string}}

It must be a valid JSON (i.e. no C-like comments, ...).

Each tag from among the candidate tags must be exactly once in the output JSON.
Do not use escaped TeX (e.g. "\angle", "\perp", etc.) in the "Justification" field.
The field "GoodnessOfFit" must be a real number between 0 and 1, and it should be
a numerical value representing how good of a fit the tag is (0 meaning no fit at all,
1 meaning perfect fit).
