I will give you a list candidate tags (in Slovak) describing math problems. I will also give you
a list of known tags (that have already been approved). For each of the candidate tags,
you should verify whether it satisfies the tag rules listed below and whether it is new
(i.e. not among the list of known tags). Approve new tags that satisfy the rules, and reject
the others.

{tag_rules}

CANDIDATE TAGS:
{candidate_tags}

KNOWN TAGS (sorted by category):
{known_tags}

If you spot multiple candidate tags that are synonymous, then only one of them should be approved.
If you spot a candidate tag that is similar or synonymous with an already known tag, then that
candidate tag should be rejected. If you spot a tag that seems to fit better into a different
category, you should reject that tag (e.g. 'Nerovnosti' should not fall into the category Area,
but under Term instead; the corresponding Area would be 'Algebra').

Also, here is a list of forbidden tags. If you encounter any of those among the candidate tags,
you should reject them too.

FORBIDDEN TAGS:
{forbidden_tags}

You must output a JSON (and only this JSON) with the following format:
{[tag]: {"Approved": true | false, "Reason": string}}

i.e. the individual tags are the keys of the JSON object, the values are JSON objects/dicts
saying whether the tag has been approved and the reason behind the decision. For each tag,
specify a non-empty string as "Reason" only if that tag has been rejected.
