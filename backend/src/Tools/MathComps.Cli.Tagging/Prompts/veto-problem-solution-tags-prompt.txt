I will give you a math problem and a candidate list of
tags (each with an optional description, and a justification why it is
being considered for the math problem). Each of the tags given is about
the problem solution. I want you to verify each of the tags,
i.e. either approve or reject it.

PROBLEM: {problem_statement}
SOLUTION: {problem_solution}

List of candidate tags has the following format:

{[tag]: {"TagCategory": string, "TagDescription": string, "Justification": string}}

CANDIDATE TAGS:
{candidate_tags}

You must output a JSON (and only this JSON) with the following format:
{[tag]: {"Approved": true | false, "Justification": string}}

It must be a valid JSON (i.e. no C-like comments, ...).

Each tag from among the candidate tags must be exactly once in the output JSON.
You should provide a justification only if the tag is rejected i.e. "Approved" is false;
otherwise, leave the justification empty.
