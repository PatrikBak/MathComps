- Write descriptive XML documentation that helps the reader understand context and intent, not just what types are involved.
- When adding XML documentation, always include:
  - `<param>` for each parameter
  - `<returns>` for the return value
- Use `<inheritdoc/>` where possible instead of repeating comments, e.g. comment on interface, inheritdoc on implementation
- Always write useful inline comments
- Prefer comments above code rather than at the end of lines for better readability
- Make sure that both XML documentation and inline comments tell a story, not restate code
- Avoid abbreviated variables, even in lambdas
- Run tests from the backend directory using `dotnet test` for non-interactive test execution
